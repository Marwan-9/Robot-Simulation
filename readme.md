# Robotic Arm Motion Simulator
MATLAB code to simulate the basic functions of three-links planar robotic arm (RRR).

## Overview
This code is written to simulates the basic RRR-robot functions like DKPM, IKPM, arm motion and also plots the working area of the robot. This was a task in "Intro to Robotics" course in Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department.

## How it works 
1. Download files on yor local machine.
2. Run "Main.m" file, **MATLAB 2019 or higher is preferred.**
3. A menu will appear to choose which function to simulate. \
